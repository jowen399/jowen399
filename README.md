 **An investigation into a predictive data model to forecast football match outcomes.** : This project combines data from different sources to assess whether it is possible to predict the outcome of a football match using 'Expected Goal' data.
 * Skills used:
    * Combining and cleaning datasets from different sources using the Pandas Library
    * Visualising data using MatPlotLib and Seaborn
    * Using machine learning models to predict outcomes (Classification and Regression problems) 
    * Critical evaluation of results

 **Applying Machine Learning Algorithms** : This project applies machine learning algorithms to a dataset containing player attributes from the popular video game 'Fifa 19'.
 * Skills used:
    * Data cleaning using the pandas library
    * Visualising data using MatPlotLib and Seaborn
    * Using machine learning models to predict outcomes (supervized and unsupervized)
